    <center>  <h1>Poor Family Story Summary </h1>
   <pre>  <p><b> The story begins with a man who is frail, hungry, and extremely poor.</b> 
         <i>He was also very lonely, without any family of his own.
         The man had no job, and he begged for money and food. 
         Every day, after asking for morsels and pennies from pedestrians on the street.
         the man would go back to his hut and keep all of his day’s earnings inside an earthen pot hung beside his bed.
         One day, the man was tired of begging all day, and decided to sleep early. 
         During his deep slumber, he began dreaming.</i>
         <u>In his dreams, he was a wealthy man with bountiful riches. 
         He also saw that he was no longer lonely, and had a beautiful wife, and they had many children.
         The man dreamt that he possessed the best-in-class luxuries, there was no scarcity of food in his house.
          and rather the dining table was filled with scrumptious-looking delicacies.</u> 
         <big>The man continued to dream and saw that his children were playing and jumping around his big mansion.
          and he also began to join them.</big>
        <strong> While he was playing with his children in the dream, the poor began to move his legs fervently and the earthen pot beside his bed fell and broke. 
         The man woke up with a startle, and realized that all his riches were a mere dream. 
         Then, he looked down to see his night’s food being splattered across the floor. </strong>The poor man’s face fell, and he again went back to sleep, feeling hungry and miserable</p></pre></center>
